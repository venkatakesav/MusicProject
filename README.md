Here's a modular Python implementation of the proposed approach, which allows for easy modifications and experimentation with different tables and ablations:

Here's how the code works:

The MAPPING_TABLES dictionary stores the mapping tables for different ragas. Each raga has an "alphabet_to_swara" dictionary that maps each alphabet to its corresponding swara sequence, and an "amsa_swara" value that represents the amsa swara for that raga.
The encrypt function takes a plaintext and a raga as input, and returns the corresponding ciphertext. It iterates through the plaintext, replaces each character with its swara sequence, and adds the amsa swara as a delimiter.
The decrypt function takes a ciphertext and a raga as input, and returns the corresponding plaintext. It splits the ciphertext by the amsa swara delimiter, looks up the corresponding alphabet for each swara sequence, and concatenates them to form the plaintext.
The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the encrypt and decrypt functions with the "Mayamalavagowla" raga.
To try different ablations or modify the mapping, you can simply update the MAPPING_TABLES dictionary with the desired changes. For example, to use the "Harikambhoji" raga, you can replace "Mayamalavagowla" with "Harikambhoji" in the example usage.

Additionally, you can add more functionality, such as:

Generating the music clip from the swara sequence using a sound synthesis library like pydub or scipy.io.wavfile.
Implementing a secure key exchange mechanism between the sender and receiver.
Providing a command-line interface or a GUI for easier usage.
Exploring different optimization techniques, such as mapping more frequent letters to shorter swara sequences.
